This writeup will serve as a "rough" version of a mini-guide until we produce a a better document.

It contains minimal instructions for modeling with GENIE interactions of nu (pid=14) on Hydrocarbon 
and comparing simulated results vs measurements by MINERvA (arXiv:1305.2243; PRL 111 022502 (2013)).

1. General Info and Setup

In order to build and run the application, you'll need:
-- GENIE package (and all its externals/dependencies)
-- RooMUHisto package (see papt 2)

GENIE is often centrally available of many machines/clusters at Fermilab.

The RooMUHisto package needs to be build, as it's still development/test stage.

For this particular excercise you need to do the following:

a) login to cluck.fnal.gov
b) source /products/setup
c) setup genie v2_8_0d -q "e4:prof"
d) build/setup RooMUHistos - see part 2
e) if you have RooMUHistos already build, you'll only need to run the following:
   cd /to/where/RooMUHistos
   source env_set.sh
   
Now you should be reasonably set to build and run the application.

2. Histogram Plotter-Analyzer (RooMUHistos)

We use the RooMUHisto framework to display and compare the experimental data and/or simulated results.

WARNING: The RooMUHisto framework is still under development. This application should be considered as
it's beta-testing. Some features of the RooMUHisto framework may still present usage problems.

The framework is freely available from the GitHub:
https://github.com/ManyUniverseAna/RooMUHistos

In addition to a variety of plotting utilities, it also offers several functionalities for a statistical 
analysis of the simulated results vs experimental data.

The package is supplied with a small README that offers startup tips.

The source code of the package is also outfitted with doxygen-style documentation.

Minimal instructions are as follow:

a) choose where you want to install the package
b) git clone https://github.com/ManyUniverseAna/RooMUHistos
c) Bear in mind that upon GENIE setup you'll have ROOT setup as well, so you wont need to worry about
   installing ROOT which is required for RooMUHisto
d) cd RooMUHistos
e) source env_set.sh
f) cd PlotUtils
g) make

If you wish, yu can also build and try examples
h) cd ../macros
i) make

NOTE: There's also a forked revision of RooMUHistos at the following URL:
https://github.com/yarba/RooMUHistos

In general, the plan is to merge any changes into the principal vesrion of RooMUHistos.
However, there maybe times when the forked revision may contain some slight modifications 
vs the "principal" one.


3. Generate GENIE sample

One can generate a desired GENIE sample using pre-fabricated gengev utility.

Instruction for using prefabricated gevgen utility start of page 69 of 
the GENIE Physics and User's Manual which can be found here:
https://genie.hepforge.org/manuals/GENIE_PhysicsAndUserManual_20130615.pdf

  -- Splines

One of the components needed for GENIE event generation are splines.

For this particular application you can download the vA splines from hepforge.

Example:
   mkdir splines
   cd splines
   wget  https://www.hepforge.org/archive/genie/data/2.8.0/gxspl-vA-v2.8.0.xml.gz
   gunzip gxspl-vA-v2.8.0.xml.gz

  -- Composite target
  
MINERvA target is made of Hydrocarbon (CH), which should be treated as a composite target.

In the target definition on input to gevgen we use fractional atomic weights.

  -- Flux file
  
The MINERvA flux files for nu and nubar have been extracted from the MINERvA publications.
We have stored them with the application as 
./flux-MINERvA/nu-flux-MINERvA.data
./flux-MINERvA/nubar-flux-MINERvA.data

  -- Running gengev with the neutrino projectile

gevgen -r 1 -n 100000 -p 14 -e 1.5,10 -t1000010010[0.077418],1000060120[0.922582] \
--cross-sections ./splines/gxspl-vA-v2.8.0.xml \
-f ./flux-MINERvA/nu-flux-MINERvA.data

This will generate 100K events for the neutrino ( -p 14 ) projectile incident of the 
Hydrocarbon target (the -t argument field ) using splines for vA and MINERvA flux file.
Based on the contents of the MINERvA flux file, the neutrino energy range is set at 1.5-10GeV 
( -e 1.5,10).
The run number is 1 ( -r 1 ). 
Because the the run number is 1 in this case, the output file will be named gntp.1.ghep.root 
(in general, the naming convenstion is gntp.<run-number>.ghep.root).
Unfortunately, there's no input argument to explicitly name the output of gevgen.
You have to be careful when generating multiple sample as you always have to make sure that
the run number is unique (unless you wish to override). 

If you wish to generate a nubar sample, please use appropriate input arguments, as follows:
-r <Unique-ID-of-your-choice>
-p -14
-f ./flux-MINERvA/nubar-flux-MINERvA.data
The target definition and the cross-sections are the same as in generating neutrino sample.

The generation time is going to vary depending on your CPU; for example, it takes ~30-40min 
of wall clock time on cluck.fnal.gov (AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 6136).
The output file size is going to be ~80Mb. 
If you need a larger statistics, please plan your resources accordingly.
In case you wish to split the statistics into multiple jobs, please bear in mind the [ -seed YourSeed ] 
input argument of the gevgen utility, to set appropriate seeds for your parallel jobs.
Also make sure to set a unique run number of each of the fractional jobs.

Just in case, below is some info from MINERvA Geant-based MC, as we've used it as guidance
to define the Hydrocarbon target.
-----------------------------------------------------

Hydrocarbon as it's defined in MINERvA Geant4 Simulation (GDML desc.);
they're using fractional atomic weights:

<material formula=" " name="sMinervaPlasticScint0x116c9670" >
   <D value="1.043" />
   <fraction n="0.077418" ref="sHydrogen0x116bf1b0" />
   <fraction n="0.922582" ref="sCarbon0x116be670" />
</material>
<element Z="1" formula=" " name="sHydrogen0x116bf1b0" >
   <atom value="1.00794" />
</element>
<element Z="6" formula=" " name="sCarbon0x116be670" >
   <atom value="12.011" />
</element>

-----------------------------------------------------

4. GENIE Event Reweighting

GENIE Event Reweighting machinery is described in GENIE manual, pp.129-156.

In this application we varied the Axial mass for CC quasi-elastic.

We have used the standard pre-fabricated grwght1scan utility that is available with the GENIE install. 

As an input to it we have used (a copy of) pre-generated GENIE sample.

Example usage is as follows:

grwght1scan -f gntp.1.ghep.root -s MaCCQE -t 5

Please note that "MaCCQE" is the name of the GENIE parameter that describes the axial mass for CC QE.
For the list of other names, please see $GENIE/src/ReWeight/GSyst.h 

We have specified 5 "tweak dial" for this parameter. It means that the system will pick 5 variants in the
range from -1 to 1. 

The name of the output file will be weights_MaCCQE.root.
Note that there's no input argument to explicitly specy the name of the output of grwght1scan.
When reweighting multiple samples, make sure to manually rename the output of each run.

5. The Experimental Data

The experimental data have been extracted from the MINERvA publication on nutrino quasi-elastic scattering
off neutrons on a Hydrocarbon target (arXiv:1305.2243; PRL 111 022502 (2013)). 

The data are stored in a plain ASCII file in the dedicated subdirectory:
./exp-MINERvA/nu-Hydrocarbon.data

For testing purposes there's also a "reduced" version of the data file
./exp-MINERvA/nu-Hydrocarbon-tst.dat

It does NOT include the correlation matrix. Because of this, the application will make an "error band" 
using the systematic errors.


6. The Validation Application

At present, the validation application consists of the following:

-- the experimental data reader/holder ExpData class
-- a service class IntType that is used to identify interaction kind (for example, nu on neutron
   or a nubar on proton) and properly match experiemntal data vs simulated events; this is related
   to the fact that neutrino may interact on a proton or a neutron in the CH target
-- a family of analyzers (can be expanded) that currently includes the base class BaseAnalyzer 
   and the Q2QEAnalyzer that derives from BaseAnalyzer and implements specific physics case,
   that is Q2 analysis of QEL neutrino scattering of neutrons in the CH target
-- MCAnalysis class runs a general loop over GENIE events and can collectively operate a number
   of analyzers that are added to it
-- the main program testMINERvA that uses the above mentioned software components, together with
   the functionalities of the MUPlotter from RooMUHisto packages (see paragraph 2). 

7. Building the Application

Before building the validation application itself, one needs to build the RooMUHistos package,
as it'll need to be linked.
Please use the README instructions that come with RooMUHistos.

Once RooMUHisto is configured and built, the validation application can be build with the help of
the provided Makefile; simply type "make".

The resulting executable will be tstMINERvA.

8. Running the Application

At present the executable does NOT require any input arguments (the exp.data set, the path 
to GENIE sample, and the path to GENIE re-weighting output are currently hardcoded).

you can run it as follows:
./tstMINERvA

However, in the nearest future we'll outfit the application with the functionalities to process 
multiple datasets and multiple GENIE samples; thus the interface may change soon. 

9. Output

At present, the application produces 4 (four) GIF-formatted images:
-- test1.gif - an overlay of MINERvA data and the GENIE predicions, including an uncertainty band on the MC,
               that come from varirying M_a parameter of GENIE (re-weighting); the chi2/ndf on the CV histo
	       is calculated using the data error matrix
-- test2.gif - an overlay of MINERvA data and the GENIE predicions, where the uncertainty band is represented
               but several color-coded histogram that the band is composed of; the chi2/ndf on the CV histo
	       is calculated using the data error matrix; the chi2/ndf is also calculated for each variant in
	       the band, also using the data error matrix 
-- test3.gif - Data/MC ratio plot, including the uncertainty band on the MC: the chi2/ndf on the CV histo is
               calculated using the uncertainties on the MC (from re-weighting)
-- test4.gif - an overlay of MINERvA and the GENIE predictions, including the uncertaintiy band on the MC,
               all in the form of "shape-only"; the chi2/ndf is also calculated with the "shape-only" technique,
	       using the data shape-only error matrix
